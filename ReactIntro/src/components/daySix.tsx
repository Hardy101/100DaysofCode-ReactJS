Key Concepts in React Router
Routes
Define paths that map to components. Each route renders a specific component when the path matches the browser URL.

Links
Use Link or NavLink to navigate between routes without reloading the page.

Router Components

BrowserRouter: Used for web apps with clean URLs (most common).
HashRouter: Uses # in the URL (e.g., example.com/#/home).
MemoryRouter: Useful for testing or non-browser environments.
Switch/Routes
Routes (formerly Switch in older versions) ensures only one route is matched and rendered.

Navigate
Programmatic navigation between routes.
